# 🚗 Self-Driving Car with ESP32 and Pixy2

![Demo of the Car in Action](images/pixyLineDetection.gif)

This project implements a self-driving car using an ESP32 microcontroller, a Pixy2 camera for line tracking, and a PID controller for steering and motor control. The car follows a line using computer vision and adjusts its speed and direction dynamically.🚦🛣️

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. **🔧 Hardware Setup**:
   - Assemble the car chassis and mount the ESP32, Pixy2, motor driver, and servo.
   - Connect the components as per the wiring diagram above.
   - Ensure all GND connections are shared between the ESP32, Pixy2, and power supplies.

2. **💻 Software Setup**:
   - Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Add the ESP32 board to the Arduino IDE:
     1. Go to `File > Preferences`.
     2. Add the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
        ```
        https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
        ```
     3. Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`, search for `ESP32`, and install the package.
   - Install the required libraries:
     - `ESP32Servo` (for servo control).
     - `Pixy2` (for Pixy2 camera communication).

3. **🚀 Upload the Code**:
   - Clone this repository or download the code.
   - Open the `main.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the correct board (`ESP32 Dev Module`) and port.
   - Upload the code to the ESP32.

4. **🏁 Run the Car**:
   - Place the car on a line track.
   - Power on the car and observe it following the line.

## 📝 Code Structure
The code is organized into modular files for better readability and maintainability:
- **`main.ino`**: Main program logic.
- **`config.h`**: Hardware configuration (pins, constants).
- **`motor_control.h`**: Functions for controlling the motors.
- **`servo_control.h`**: Functions for controlling the steering servo.
- **`pid_controller.h`**: PID control logic for steering.
- **`pixy2_utils.h`**: Functions for processing Pixy2 camera data.
- **`diagnostics.h`**: Debugging and diagnostics utilities.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Line Detection**:
   - The Pixy2 camera detects the line and provides the coordinates of the line vectors.
   - The midpoint of the line is calculated to determine the car's deviation from the center.
   - Below is a visual of Pixy2's camera output and data reading:

2. **PID Control**:
   - A PID controller calculates the steering angle based on the deviation from the centerline.
   - The steering servo adjusts the car's direction to follow the line.

3. **Motor Control**:
   - The motors are controlled based on the deviation to maintain a consistent speed.
   - If no line is detected, the motors stop.

4. **Diagnostics**:
   - Debugging information (e.g., line coordinates, deviation, steering angle) is printed to the Serial Monitor.
